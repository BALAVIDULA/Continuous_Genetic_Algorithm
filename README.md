# Continuous_Genetic_Algorithm
Generating optimized solution for the objective function using Continuous GA

Consider the cost function 

                    Cost =  f(x,y) = x sin(4x) + 1.1 y sin(2y)


Subject to the constraints: 

                              0≤x≤10 and 0≤y≤10


Since f is a function of x and y only, the clear choice for the variable is

                            Chromosome = [x, y]
